                    Katie is an artist finding her way in this world, taking it one day at a time in this journey
                    called "life". Katie has always been a creative soul, from a young age she was drawn to crafting and artistic endeavors  
                    Her passion has guided her through the strenuous quest of supporting herself professionally as a Ceramic Artist in this unforgiving 
                    capitalistic society.

                    Katie has been learning and practicing art in a diverse array of settings and artistic mediums. She engaged herself
                    in all of the available art courses in high school which built up the drive and momentum that propelled her through 
                    working towards and acheiving her Bachelor's of Art in Ceramics. Although her college was in her home state, she has travelled extensively
                    domestically and internationally to go observe and participate in Art Culture in many ways in order to discover what this 
                    world had to offer an artist in her position.

                    Since graduating from the University of Central Missouri, Katie has amassed a long list of endeavors in and out of her desired
                    field. This world is not very kind to artists, it likes to take advantage of their passions to get them to accept lower 
                    compensation and poor working conditions. Katie's journey has been no exception, she's gone through trial and error with the different 
                    jobs and opportunities that have come to her, she's has found friends to support her and mentors to learn from along the way, and she's had successes and failures 
                    fitting those endeavors in with her long term goals of supporting herself through her art.

                    Katie has experienced much of the pitfalls of pursuing a career in the arts first hand as well as witnessing her 
                    peers go through similar struggles. She has persevered through each barrier in her path and done everything she can 
                    to be working for her own best interest at her own pace. Katie wants to be an outspoken community member and leader, she hopes
                    to be creating physical work and online content that other artists and creative souls can appreciate and absorb helpful 
                    lessons about patience, perseverence, and self-kindness in the Art Community.
